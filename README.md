# Euploidy Prediction

**Six models, including**
* logistic regression
* decision tree
* extreme gradient boosting
* random forest
* support vector machine
* multilayer perceptron

**are trained for euploidy prediction in human blastocysts on Day 6. The model input is five morphological parameters, including**
* blastocyst diameter
* TE cell number
* TE cell density
* TE cell size variance
* ICM area

**determined by 3D morphology measurement, and the output is the PGT-A result.**
